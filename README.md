## API:
  * LegoAPI
     * An API to create standardize lego pieces based on the user inputed number of rows and columns. It self adjusts for the type of post(hollow/ solid) for that particular piece.
  * Circles Inside an Octagon API
     * An API to create a octagon with circles inside of it, it takes circle radius, distance , and the octagon size
  * 3D Circular Head with Platform and Brace API
     * An API that creates a protruding head with a platform and brace. It takes holesize, arcdiameter, rib width, height, necksize, baseheight, and basewidth as parameters, so its easier to customize the piece.
